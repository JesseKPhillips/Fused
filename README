== FUSED ==
At least basic functionallity is working for Fuse 2.8, older versions are not supported but may work. The example hello program and a port of the TagFS project.

==== IMPORTANT ====

D has an issue with stat_t. At this time you can not use it. If you wish to make changes to the structure pass it to a c file that you compile seperately. You can see an example with the hello example.

I'll look into adding tests, and this structure being one of them.
